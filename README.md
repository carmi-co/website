# carmi

Carmi website can be visited at https://carmi-co.github.io/website/

It is hosted using Github pages and uploaded to an orphan branch named gh-pages, here you have to upload the index and the dist folder after bundled.

##Bundling

###npm start
Once cloned, running the script npm start opens the website as it is, and has hot module realoding plugged so you can edit and see changes immediately.

###npm start
This script npm run creates the files necessary to deploy the website to Github pages.
**Note: Quick fix, make sure you can add '/website' to the routes in the router file as Github will add that to the URL.**
